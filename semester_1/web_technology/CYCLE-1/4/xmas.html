	<p>Christmas is celebrated to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God. 
	The name 'Christmas' comes from the Mass of Christ (or Jesus). A Mass service (which is sometimes called Communion or Eucharist) is where 
	Christians remember that Jesus died for us and then came back to life.
