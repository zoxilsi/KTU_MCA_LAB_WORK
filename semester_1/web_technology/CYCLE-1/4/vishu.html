	<p>Vishu (Sanskrit: “equal”) celebrates the vernal equinox, when day and night are roughly equal length. 
	Although the astronomical equinox falls in late March, the Vishu festival falls on the first day of the Malayali month of Medam, 
	which occurs on either April 14 or 15 on the Gregorian calendar
